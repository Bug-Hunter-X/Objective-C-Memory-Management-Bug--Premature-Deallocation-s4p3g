# Objective-C Memory Management Bug: Premature Deallocation

This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug related to memory management and provides a solution.

**Bug:**
The bug involves the premature deallocation of an object due to improper handling of reference counts.  An object is created, but not properly retained, leading to unexpected behavior and potential crashes when accessing it after it has been deallocated.

**Solution:**
The solution focuses on correctly managing the object's lifecycle using proper `retain` and `release` (or ARC's equivalent) calls to ensure the object persists as long as it's needed.
