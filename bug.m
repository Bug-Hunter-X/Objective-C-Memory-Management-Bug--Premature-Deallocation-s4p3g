In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to object ownership and the intricacies of reference counting.  Consider the scenario where an object (let's call it 'myObject') is created and added to an array. If 'myObject' is not properly retained by the array or another object, and the only strong reference to 'myObject' goes out of scope, it will be prematurely deallocated, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior later on. This is especially tricky when working with delegate patterns or complex object relationships.
