To fix this issue, ensure that 'myObject' is retained by the array or another object that has a longer lifespan.  If using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), the solution is generally simpler, but vigilance is still required.  Ensure proper strong references exist within your objects' relationships.  For example, if adding 'myObject' to an `NSMutableArray`, the array will retain it. However, if you remove it from the array, and no other object is retaining it, ensure that you retain it elsewhere if you need to use it beyond that point in the code.

// Incorrect (potential premature deallocation)
NSMutableArray *myArray = [NSMutableArray array];
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[myArray addObject:myObject];
[myObject release]; // This causes a crash if myObject is only referenced in myArray

// Correct (using ARC, the array will retain the object)
NSMutableArray *myArray = [NSMutableArray array];
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[myArray addObject:myObject];
// myObject is retained by myArray, no explicit release needed in ARC.

// Correct (Manual Reference Counting)
NSMutableArray *myArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[myArray addObject:myObject];
[myObject retain]; //Retain if needed elsewhere
// ... use myObject ...
[myObject release]; //Release when done
[myArray release];
